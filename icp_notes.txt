Need to have roscore running in T1
Need to have rviz running in T2
Need to run rosrun icp_node solver
Need to playback rosbag with rosbag play LOG_NAME.bag in T3

[X] Need to figure out how to read laser scan data from rosbag in my node
[X] Need to make a class that can save 2 subsequent scans 
[] Need to be able to make data associations with each scan
  [X] Convert points to x,y pairs
  [X] Determine Center of Mass of both data sets
  [X] Distance between the two COMs will give a good translation approximation
  [] Visualize this com movement
    [] Need to publish COM points (x,y) and translation vector (could just be a line between both COM points for the timebeing)



Now the best way to make data associations, I THINK, is to perform a Nearest neighbor algorithm from one point in the source scan to all the points in the target scan.
